## Inspiration

We were inspired to create MissMarket to address the gender gap in financial literacy, particularly among middle and high school girls. We wanted to empower young women to take control of their financial futures and break down barriers in traditionally male-dominated fields like investing. 

## What It Does

MissMarket is an app designed to educate middle and high school girls about stocks and investing through paper trading. Users can learn about the stock market, practice trading with virtual money, and gain confidence in their financial decision-making skills in a safe and supportive environment.

## How We Built It

We built MissMarket using a combination of user-centered design principles and educational content development. The app features interactive lessons, simulated trading environments, and real-time market data integration to provide a comprehensive learning experience. We also collaborated with financial experts and educators to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the content.

## Challenges We Ran Into

One of the main challenges we faced was designing an engaging and intuitive user interface that would appeal to our target audience of middle and high school girls. We also encountered difficulties in balancing the complexity of financial concepts with the need for accessibility and simplicity in the app's design. Since our team had limited knowledge about stocks, determining the most essential content for teaching financial literacy was also challenging.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

We are proud to have created a platform that empowers young women to develop essential financial literacy skills and gain confidence in their ability to navigate the stock market. Seeing our users grow and succeed in their financial journeys is incredibly rewarding and validates the impact of our work.

## What We Learned

Through the process of building MissMarket, we learned the importance of tailoring educational content to specific demographics and the value of incorporating interactive and hands-on learning experiences. We also gained insights into the unique challenges and opportunities in promoting financial literacy among young women.

## What's Next for MissMarket

In the future, we plan to expand MissMarket's features and content to cover a broader range of financial topics, including budgeting, saving, and long-term financial planning. We also aim to further enhance the app's user experience and accessibility to reach a wider audience of young women and continue making a positive impact on their financial futures.
